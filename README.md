# Precision CMOS Layout Design using 90nm Technology

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a CMOS layout using the GPDK 90 nm process technology in Cadence Virtuoso.  
The work involves creating the schematic, generating the corresponding layout, and performing essential physical verification steps such as Design Rule Check (DRC) and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) to ensure design correctness and manufacturability.  
The aim is to achieve an optimized and rule-compliant CMOS design suitable for VLSI fabrication standards.

## Tools and Technology

- **Cadence Virtuoso 6.1.7-64b** – Schematic and Layout Design  
- **Calibre v2016.1_14.11** – Physical Verification (DRC, LVS)  
- **GPDK 90 nm** – Process Design Kit (PDK) used for technology-specific parameters and rules
