# Precision CMOS Layout Design using 90nm Technology

This project involves the complete design and verification of a CMOS layout using the GPDK 90 nm process technology in Cadence Virtuoso.  
The design process began with schematic creation, followed by layout implementation, and concluded with physical verification to ensure the design meets both functional and manufacturing requirements.  

Physical verification included:  
- **Design Rule Check (DRC)** – Ensures the layout follows all manufacturing rules specified in the PDK, confirming that the design can be fabricated without violations.  
- **Layout Versus Schematic (LVS)** – Confirms that the physical layout exactly matches the intended schematic in terms of connectivity and components.  

Passing both DRC and LVS indicates that the design is rule-compliant, functionally correct, and ready for fabrication, minimizing the risk of costly errors during manufacturing.

## Tools and Technology
